        <h1>Privacy Policy for Loan Affordability Calculator</h1>

        <h2>Last Updated: August 19, 2025</h2>

        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the practices of the Loan Affordability Calculator app ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and want to be transparent about our data practices.</p>

        <p>Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Information we do not collect</h2>

        <p>The Loan Affordability Calculator App is designed to operate without collecting any personal information from its users. We do not require you to create an account, and we do not ask for, or store, any personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or financial details.</p>

        <p>All calculations are performed locally on your device, and the data you input (e.g., loan amount, interest rate, income, expenses) is not transmitted to us or any third parties. When you close the App, all session data is cleared.</p>

        <h2>2. No third-party data sharing</h2>

        <p>Because we do not collect any personal data, we do not share any data with third-party companies, including advertisers, analytics providers, or any other service providers.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Security</h2>

        <p>Since the App does not collect or transmit any of your personal information, there is no data to secure on our servers. The data you enter remains on your device for the duration of your session and is under your direct control.</p>

        <h2>4. Chnages to this privacy policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
