## How to Add Your Images

To add your blog images:

1. Create or select appropriate images for each blog post
2. Optimize the images for web use (compress them to reduce file size)
3. Name the files according to the list above (e.g., blog-post1.jpg)
4. Place all images in this directory (`images/blog/`)

## Temporary Solution

Until you add these images, the blog is using placeholder images from the placehold.co service. These placeholders are directly referenced in the HTML and JavaScript files.

If you want to generate your own placeholder images, you can use the script provided in `js/generate-blog-placeholders.js`. This script will output URLs for placeholder images that you can use temporarily.

## Important Note

All images should be optimized for web (compressed JPG or PNG files) to ensure fast loading times. The recommended dimensions for blog post featured images are 1200×800 pixels.
